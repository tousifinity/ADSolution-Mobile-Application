# ADSolution: Predict Alzheimer Disease, Patient Monitoring & Safety Using IoT

This project leverages **IoT** technology combined with **Deep Learning** to improve the management and care of patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD). By utilizing advanced machine learning techniques, real-time monitoring, and location tracking, the system aims to provide enhanced support to patients and caregivers.

## Key Contributions

1. **Alzheimer's Disease Classification using Deep Learning**:
   - We employ **MobileNetV2**, a powerful deep learning model, to classify Alzheimer's disease by analyzing brain MRI scans.
   - Achieved a high accuracy rate for classification.

2. **Real-time Monitoring with IoT Devices**:
   - Utilizes an IoT device to continuously measure and monitor **physiological** and **environmental** parameters such as:
     - Temperature
     - Humidity
     - Heart rates
     - SpO2 (Blood Oxygen Saturation)
   - Instant notifications are sent to caregivers if any abnormal readings are detected.

3. **Live GPS Tracking**:
   - The system tracks the **real-time location** of the patient using **GPS**, ensuring that the patient remains in a safe location.
   - In case of an emergency or if the patient deviates from the safe zone, immediate help can be provided without delay.

## Features

- **MobileNetV2** for Alzheimerâ€™s disease classification from MRI scans.
- Real-time data collection for **physiological** and **environmental** parameters.
- **GPS tracking** for patient location and safety.
- **Instant caregiver notification** in case of abnormalities in data or patient location.
